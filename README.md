### What are Project Proposals?

A project proposal for DEVEN is describing a project that can solve a problem in Song Build engineering. 
DEVEN projects are technical agnostic, which means we want to make tooling that is supporting processes, not boilerplates.

### Why Project Proposals?

We want to make sure the idea you are submitting is thought through and well rounded, it is something you care about so deeply, you want to invest the time in research and the proposal.

### How to submit a Project Proposal?
Please [file an issue for a project proposal](https://git.sinnerschrader.com/deven/project-proposals/-/issues/new) and use the provided issue template for that. Discussions can happen inside the issues to clarify questions, add context or interate the idea.
